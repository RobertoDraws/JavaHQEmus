# JavaHQEmulators

HQ Trivia is an iOS and Android app which fundamental goal was to give away a money prize-pot if answered right all 12 questions asked scaling up in difficulty. This project from sniffing network requests from my phone and recreating them in Java to be able to 'hypothetically' play on various accounts (with stored bearer tokens). 

Java Class with full access to the HQAPI. Capable of running in game ~10,000 accounts (as long as you have the bearers and open ports to connect).
